# `@agent-topology/langgraph`

Describe a supported compiled LangGraph.js `StateGraph` as the canonical document
representation from `@agent-topology/spec`.

```bash
npm install @agent-topology/spec@0.1.0-beta.2 @agent-topology/langgraph@0.1.0-beta.2
```

Supports Node.js 20+ and is ESM-only; synchronous `require()` is unsupported.
Install the specification peer explicitly. LangGraph.js 1.4.14 is installed as a
runtime dependency. Save JavaScript examples as `.mjs`, or use `.js` with
`"type": "module"`.
For a complete graph you can run without a model or API key, follow the
[quickstart](https://github.com/agent-topology/agent-topology/blob/main/docs/getting-started/typescript.md).

For an existing compiled graph in an ESM module:

```ts
import { describe } from "@agent-topology/langgraph";

const document = await describe(compiledGraph);
const expanded = await describe(compiledGraph, { depth: 1 });
```

The producer supports LangGraph.js 1.4.14. Other versions are refused before graph
inspection with an installation command for the tested release. The default depth is
zero, so nested graphs stay opaque. Framework-only observations are emitted beneath
`x-langgraph`; producer-wide limitations and graph-specific element-local gaps remain
separate.

This package exposes no command-line executable.

CommonJS callers can use `await import("@agent-topology/langgraph")` inside an
async function, then await `describe(compiledGraph)`. Follow the
[complete CommonJS example with error handling](https://github.com/agent-topology/agent-topology/blob/main/docs/getting-started/typescript.md#use-it-from-commonjs).

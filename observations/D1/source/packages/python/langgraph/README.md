# agent-topology-langgraph

Describe a compiled Python LangGraph workflow as an agent-topology JSON document.
Supports Python 3.11–3.14 and LangGraph 1.2.10–1.2.11. Untested framework versions
are refused before inspection.

```bash
python -m pip install "agent-topology-langgraph==0.1.0b2"
agt describe path/to/graph.py:graph --out topology.json
```

The target is a Python file and the name of its compiled graph object. Importing
the file executes its module-level statements; extraction does not invoke the
graph. Inspect trusted targets only.

```python
from agent_topology.langgraph import IncompleteTopologyError, describe

# compiled_graph is the result of your application's StateGraph.compile().
try:
    document = describe(compiled_graph, strict=True)
except IncompleteTopologyError as error:
    document = error.document
    print(document["completeness"]["gaps"])
```

The optional `depth` argument defaults to `0`, keeping subgraphs opaque. Read
both graph-specific gaps and producer-wide limitations. Only gaps fail strict
mode. The CLI's `--strict` option still writes an incomplete document and exits
with status `6`.

Installation includes the specification dependency and the `agt` executable.
The document is a provisional 0.1 contract, not a runtime, viewer, or proof of
policy compliance.
